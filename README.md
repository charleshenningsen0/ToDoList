How to use:
Clone repositiory and open code editor for python. (I used PyCharm Community Version - Free)
install Pyqt
```{r, engine='sh', count_lines}
pip install pyqt6
```


If you  need to change untitled.ui with QtDesigner, don't forget to regenerate gui.py file using this command:  
```{r, engine='sh', count_lines}
pyuic6 -x untitled.ui -o gui.py
```
